# Matrix

A programming language with a focus on easy matrix calculations.

- Compiles to GNU Assembler
- Python like syntax
- Matrix object will be very similar to a Numpy ndarray object
- Easy to extend (uses the Sly lexer/parser framework)
- MIT license

Very much a work in progress and intended as a personal exercise in creating something a little bit more complete than your average toy language.
